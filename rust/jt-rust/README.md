# Day 4 Rust solution

Decided to try something completely brand new to me for the day 4 challenge. Going to be using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

## Setup
1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then make sure it can run with `rustc --version` and `cargo --version`
2. Build the project with `cargo run` or `cargo build` and then call the built binary in the `/target` folder directly
3. Verify code integrity with `cargo check`

## Test
Run `cargo test`
